# SQL-Music_Store_Analysis
SQL Project on Music Store Analysis:

I have just completed a series of SQL questions on Music Store Analysis. Here are some SQL queries which I found worth sharing.

About Dataset: The project data is taken from Music Store Database which is freely accessible. Importing database to SQL and creating tables named as per the csv files. Tables included- Album, Artist, Customer, Employee, Genre, Invoice, Invoice_line, Media_type, Playlist, Playlist_track and Track. 

This project helped me to sharpen my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of the SQL concepts. It includes sql queries, clauses, aggregate functions, joins and CTE query.
